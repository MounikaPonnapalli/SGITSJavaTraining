What is the difference between Interface and Functional Interface?
Interface:
An interface in Java is a blueprint of a class. It has static constants and abstract methods.

The interface in Java is a mechanism to achieve abstraction. There can be only abstract methods in the Java interface,
not method body. It is used to achieve abstraction and multiple inheritance in Java.
In other words, you can say that interfaces can have abstract methods and variables. It cannot have a method body.


Functional Interface:
An Interface that contains exactly one abstract method is known as functional interface. It can have any number of default,
static methods but can contain only one abstract method. It can also declare methods of object class.

Functional Interface is also known as Single Abstract Method Interfaces


Encapsulation:
Encapsulation in Java is a process of wrapping code and data together into a single unit,
example: a capsule which is mixed of several medicines.


Abstraction:
Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

Another way, it shows only essential things to the user and hides the internal details
example: sending SMS where you type the text and send the message. You don't know the internal processing about the message delivery.
