How a Java program runs internally?
Java is a high-end programming language. We cannot run Java programs on a normal machine
this is because high-level programming languages need to be translated into machine code
first, due to this we run them on a Java compiler. It translates java language into 
the machine language making it easier for the machine to understand it. It is stated that
it is a platform-independent language and does not work on the simple one-step 
compiling.

The working of the Java programming language can be seen in three steps.
1.we need to have a java source code otherwise we won't be able to run the program 
you need to save it with the program.java extension.
2.we need to use a compiler so that it compiles the source code which
in turn gives out the java bytecode and that needs to have a program.class extension.
The Java bytecode is a redesigned version of the java source codes, and this bytecode 
can be run anywhere irrespective of the machine on which it has been built.
3.we put the java bytecode through the Java Virtual Machine which is an interpreter that
reads all the statements thoroughly step by step from the java bytecode which will 
further convert it to the machine-level language so that the machine can execute the code.
We get the output only after the conversion is done.
