How a Java Program Runs Internally?
1) When the program starts exicuting,two areas will be created one is stack area and other is heap area
2) stack area is used for execution
3) heap area is used for storage
4) java virtual machine(JVM) makes use of 3 resources
1:class loader 2:main method 3:garbage collector
5)class loader is resposible to load all the static method into static pool area main method will be exicuted statement by statement 
6)new operator is responsible to load all the non static method into object 
7)object address will be assign to object reference variable
8)'.'operator is known as access operator
9)every method will enter stack area and exicutes and after execution is completed it will exit the stack area
10)garbage collector is responsible for cleaning heap area and stack area have a great power that it will clean by itself.
