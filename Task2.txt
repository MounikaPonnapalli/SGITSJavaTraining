What is Abstraction and Encapsulation?

Abstraction that allows us to hide unnecessary details and only show the needed information.
This allows us to manage complexity by omitting or hiding details with a simpler,higher-level idea.

A practical example of abstraction can be motorbike brakes. We know what brake does. When we apply the brake, the motorbike will stop. However, the working of the brake is kept hidden from us.
The major advantage of hiding the working of the brake is that now the manufacturer can implement brake differently for different motorbikes, however, what brake does will be the same.


Encapsulation refers to the bundling of fields and methods inside a single class.
It prevents outer classes from accessing and changing fields and methods of a class. This also helps to achieve data hiding.

For example Consider a training program. 
Participants in a class with a trainer:
Every trainee receives a personal performance report with grades and comments.

The trainees are unable to alter their own grades. The tutor grades and comments on their work after they submit it.

The grades of other trainees are confidential and cannot be seen by them.

Encapsulation in this training program translates to the trainer controlling the grades and feedback while maintaining the confidentiality of each trainee's performance.
