How a Java program runs internally?

When run the Java program, Java compiler first compiles the java code to bytecode.Then, the JVM translates bytecode into native machine code.

JVM(Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables the computer to run a Java program.

Java is a platform-independent language. It's because when  write Java
code, it's ultimately written for JVM but not the  computer.
Since JVM â€‹executes the Java bytecode which is platform-independent, Java is
platform-independent.
