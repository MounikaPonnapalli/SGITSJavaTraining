What is the difference between Interface and Functional Interface?

i) Normal Interface :
It is a blueprint of class
A normal interface can contain one or more abstract methods.
It can also have any number of static and default methods, and it can declare variables that are public static final (constants) by default.
It can include public methods from the Object class because all Java classes implicitly extend Object.

ii) Functional Interface:
A functional interface is a type of interface that has exactly one abstract method (SAM)
Similar to a normal interface, it can also have any number of static and default methods, and it can include public methods from the Object class.
Functional interfaces are designed to be used with lambda expressions and method references.
