What is the difference between Interface and Functional Interface?

i)Interface :
It is a blueprint of class
A normal interface can contain one or more abstract methods.
It can also have any number of static and default methods, and it can declare variables that are public static final (constants) by default.
It can include public methods from the Object class because all Java classes implicitly extend Object.

ii) Functional Interface:
A functional interface is a type of interface that has exactly one abstract method (SAM)
Similar to a normal interface, it can also have any number of static and default methods, and it can include public methods from the Object class.
Functional interfaces are designed to be used with lambda expressions and method references.

Example:
Online Meetings:
when ahh team lead talks individually to each team mate then it will be known as an interface so here Teammates will be acts as ahh abstract methods
when ahh team lead talks to whole team directly is known as an functional interface  so here Teammates will be acts as ahh abstract methods

Abstraction :- 
-> Abstraction are the properties of hiding the internal data and showing the functionality is known as Abstraction
Example :- laptop


Encapsulation :- 
-> Binding the code and data together in a single unit is known as Encapsulation 
Example :- library
